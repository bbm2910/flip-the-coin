# Flip a Coin Game

This is a simple **Flip a Coin** game made with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.  
I built it as a practice project to improve my skills in:

- JavaScript functions and DOM manipulation
- Working with Git and GitHub
- Building user interfaces

## How It Works

Click the "Flip Coin" button and the game will randomly show either "Heads" or "Tails".  
It also keeps a record of how many times each result occurred.
